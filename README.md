# Hackathon_CopyStoreData

In Europe a lot of international shops have store views that are partly similar.
For example Germany-German and Austria-German.
There is no easy way to copy a most of the data, we would like to create a solution for that.

  * Configuration
    * Select a store view
    * HACKATHON
      * Copy Store Data = this is applied on product save
